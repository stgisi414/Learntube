# Why is Replit so self-destructive? I'm about to explode...

[Ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/replit/?f=flair_name%3A%22Ask%22)

I have spent some time over the seasonal break exploring Replit and it's possible value to non-dev types like myself. I have gone back and forth and tried every possible angle, but there is absolutely no way to develop a passable prototype or MVP with Replit because it just self-destructs after about 20-30 processes.


Here is my experience:


I wanted to try a few random ideas out and got ChatGPT and Perplexity to give me some ideas.


I requested they present me with clear prompts for Replit.


I entered them.


Replit fully evaluated and understood the tasks at hand, repeated them back to me, and went about building the apps.


I was amazed! Watching this beast code away was exciting.


So, after Replit was satisfied it had done everything, I was essentially presented with either a basic wireframe or a non-functional login, but in every case there was next to zero functionality (despite requesting it and it being confirmed)


So, I go about asking for the previously requested functionality to be added and it was...one piece at a time - IF it worked (9/10 failed attempts to fix or add features)


Slowly we were getting there, but there were always a few bugs and errors, everywhere.


I cannot recall even ONCE did Replit succeed in producing something requested in a fully functional state first time - this is where we get even more frustrated.


EVERY time I got about 1-2 bugs away from a functional app Replit decided to edit a completely unrelated section of the app - breaking functionality to another section we weren't even looking at.


To top it all off - after about 40-50 processes almost without fail, Replit decides it has no errors - despite me still pointing them out and asking for it to fix them, and then asks for what features I want to add, without fixing previous bugs.


When I clearly point out the bugs and errors remain, there is a whole "Oh sorry I completely missed that, let me fix that for you now" loop, which lasts for ages - I fixed it - no you didn't - okay let me fix it again - no you didn't - it's done, what's next? - ummm no it is NOT done! This is an epic fail.


To top it all off I spent over $100 across 12 different apps trying different angles, ideas, recommendations, and other ways to implement just a simple user login system that provides the user with auth to app functionality when logged in. Not once have I succeeded in creating a user login system that has auth to carry out all actions on a dashboard.


Replit could be amazing - but it isn't - it is a burn on resources and causes more frustration than technical advancement. I have to date (in two weeks) spent over $300 testing every single possible angle to get a workable prototype out the door, even for simple apps, nothing complex.


Out of the 20+ projects I experimented with, **not one single app works.**

I am very disappointed.

I could have written this word for word. EXACTLY my experience building ONE app. Never functional. Finally almost there… try to enhance on thing, unrelated thing breaks like a house of cards.

Your experience is shared by many including myself. Days and nights of dedication have been spent without any thing to show but pointless files that do not function and have veered so far off course that the prompts needed to progress them seem so impossible.


I’ve rebuilt the same app 4 times and each time it seems to make more progress. It might be my prompts are now anticipating future failure points and I’m addressing them from step 1. However , that said I still have nothing to show that is functional.


The idea of what this could do is intoxicating , but once you begin using it you realize that the end goal might not be able to ever be achieved from replit.


The idea is from idea to app which is targeting the non technical entrepreneurs. Yet, the application and AI is clearly not ready for this audience.


Great example that I still can’t figure out is a workflow for allowing users to set and upload a profile image and have it saved in the replit object storage. The UI is stellar and in place, just non functional. Spent 5 hours on this alone and it’s still not working. After 3 hours I just pasted in the documentation that replit has for it , the assistant had to rewrite the entire code because it wasn’t even compatible with replits object storage. This seemed promising and after 2 hours of additional trouble shooting it still didn’t work. Still doesn’t.


Where’s the YouTube videos of successful applications being built on replit? Why isn’t there basic videos like setting up object storage for profile pictures etc? The non tech entrepreneurs want more than a forked code of a subway surfing game- we want creative applications and features that work.


The marketing and even the product is good enough to get us in the door, but the steak they sell isn’t what’s being delivered.


My mind isn’t fixed that replit is horrible , I see a lot of potential, but it’s far from delivering on its claims to the non tech community.

2 things that work for me when developing or debugging with Replit (both Agent and Assistant). Start a new feature with 'I want to develop x feature, do not make any changes at all yet, but give me your thoughts on the best way to implement.' When debugging begin with 'Without changing any other functionality or breaking anything else, carefully evaluate why x is happening across the entire codebase and then x'. I have developed a relatively complex app with fully functional features using this method. If all else fails, a new Agent or Assistant chat often does the trick. Also, if using JS in your app, use Typescript and don't leave errors unresolved just because everything seems to work OK, address and resolve asap. Finally, I have found the Assistant quite competent if prompted carefully and it is 20% of the cost of Agent. I hope your experience improves.

I use "Just Strategize, don't code yet" at the bottom of the prompt. But I'm still stuck with the issue of "Authentication flow". I'm using NextJS with Typescript. But the agent has failed to figure out how to authenticate a user and redirect it to the relevant page after authentication.


Have you built anything with a working authentication? Would be thankful if you could guide me

I have had the same experience! I worked on 3 Repl's for 5 days straight, literally 8-10 hours a day... and spent about $200. I got a beautiful operational app \*chef's kiss\* and Replit shat the bed on integrating Firebase in a way that would work for deployment. There was a dreaded error loop that you also encountered. I tried asking new and different ways. Debug this / Examine this file for best practices / Please ensure that this code is working properly per the console errors / etc.


The Agent feels more powerful and also hallucinates a ton. Forgets what I told it in the original prompt; forgets clear instructions I gave it a minute ago. The Assistant seems more detail-oriented but unable to execute broad changes. The Agent and the Assistant go back and forth removing each other's comments and code. It's infuriating and I feel for you!!

Why not just use Sonnet 3.5? It can implement any layered feature without a single bug in one shot...

Good Prompting is key.


GitHub is a must. Don’t rely just on rollbacks


Teach it! Rollback ‘you messed up and did this’ do it like this.


Ask assistant a ton of questions before prompting.


Presume it will do something stupid


Do MVP only first.


Give easy small prompts.


Ask ChatGPT for advice too.


It’s not a magic wand so learn the basics of building apps. You don’t need to code just how it’s built and best practices. Mines a flask app so needed to understanding the ins and outs to create good prompts


Somethings you’ll need to get a developer for.


It’s new and will get better


You will blow money but you will on every no code until you understand what it’s good and bad at.

Use Cursor with Sonnet or DeepSeek. Also try to use GitHub as soon in the project as possible.


You do have to have some knowledge on coding principles, the ability to understand the purpose of the code and what it’s trying to achieve. Sometimes you have to steer Cursor in the right direction, not applying changes when you feel it’s incorrect etc.


I have built two working apps this way. One is currently in Beta testing with a group of people I know and trust their opinion and expertise to give me proper feedback.


The other app was built purely to satisfy a need of my wife to quickly scan a food label of a product she is not sure contains additives that she doesn’t want to consume. It uses the API of OpenAI for image to text (via her Phone camera) to first list all’s ingredients- it then hands it over to a second “agent” that produces a final report of all the additives found, information about its properties, health, safety, allergies, known side effects etc, and ranks the product on a scale of 1-5 on metrics I provided.

Your experience is shared by anyone else who ever used Replit.


I’m a dev myself, so I have been able to fix many of the bugs it comes up with, but even then, I find myself having to stop using any assistance past the 90% completion rate. That’s when Replit enters its breakdown mode and starts touching parts of the app it shouldn’t.


I am borderline thinking this is a designed bug to generate more revenue for Replit.  People are shedding hundreds of dollars to keep running these endless loops in a never ending chase to try and fix their apps.


For me, this is a matter of statistics.  If you have an assistant that can solve 70% of the problems you give it correctly, you should be able to reach a 99% completed app after just 4 prompts.


Instead, it gives you a 70% completed app on the first prompt.  A 90% completed app after 15-20 prompts.


And then it keeps you running in circles.


Furthermore, its coding decisions can often be just plain bad. It often resorts to outdated APIs, code blocks etc.


If you don’t keep enforcing good coding practices, you end up getting a mess of spaghetti code that becomes impossible for even the best devs to troubleshoot.


While this could explain some of its shortcomings, this doesn’t explain why it randomly decides to mess with parts of one’s apps that are coded properly, clearly commented and marked, and just randomly change lines and values that have NOTHING to do with what you ask it to fix.

Replit basically hates themselves. They have put terrible limitations on free accounts forcing people to pay large chunks of money, and then treat their loyal paying customers like this. The only reason they exist now is greed.

Skill issue. You’re throwing shitty prompts at it, based off of half assed ideas that another AI generated for you. You need a better understanding of what you’re building and how you want it to work.

I have software experience but not as sharp as I used to be and I found Replit great at devising features but not implementing them. I spent the same time in Replit trying to build an app as I did with AWS and ChatGPT+Claude which turned out 100x better.


My advice would be to devise the framework and data structures in GPT then decide if it’s easier to just run it with Replit. The other drawback I found was if you want a web app, Replit doesn’t do well with React so it’s going to look terrible anyway

I had a very similar experience. I tried two different ideas and kept getting into these stupid loops where it would tell me it did something that it didn’t actually do. One of the apps was just a workout tracking application. I figured this would be very simple and would be a way for me to learn how to interact with and work with Replit before moving on to something bigger. I wanted to group my exercises into three main categories. When you choose a category, it would then show all of the exercises in that category. For the life of me, I could not get that second page of exercises to be correctly populated. it would keep telling me over and over again that it did what I asked yet it would never do it. It would list the exercises from one of the other categories but tell me it was what I asked for. I started new chats. I redid the project, and I could never get it past a single page. And even with a single page, it could never get the visual alignment right of three simple boxes on a page.


I definitely see the promise in a tool like this, but I spent hours working on some very basic things and found it very frustrating.


I had heard about Replit on the my first million podcast and they made it seem FAR more advanced than it is.

I think Replit still has some way to go yet, and you're better to use some other tools or LLM's to improve the code and debug etc. Advanced mode on Gemini or paid version of ChatGPT can do the trick and make recommendations and help setup proper interfaces...I paid the one time subscription for Replit just to see but will cancel it until it is enhanced. Early days though

Have you tried making pieces separately and then patching them together like a puzzle ? AI still has limitations you can’t just expect to do everything with no problems. Do a step e.g make a login page then new project make a dashboard then merge them together and then if you run into errors ask it “why am I getting this error” and then you have a functional dashboard with secure login :)
