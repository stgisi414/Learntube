Deployment Types

Static Deployments

Static Deployments host your Replit App’s static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
on a cloud server. The server automatically uses caching and scaling strategies to deliver
your content quickly and economically.

Static Deployments are ideal for the following use cases:

- Marketing landing pages
- Portfolio websites
- Product and API documentation sites

Static Deployments are not compatible with Replit Apps created using Agent.
Agent automatically creates full-stack apps that require a backend server.
For Agent-generated apps, use one of the following deployment types:

- [Autoscale Deployment](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments)
- [Reserved VM Deployment](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments)

## [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#features)  Features

Static Deployments include the following features:

- **Cost-effective hosting**: Pay only for the amount of data your website serves.
- **HTTP routing options**: Configure response headers, URL rewrites, and redirects.
- **Custom domains**: Configure a custom domain or use a `<app-name>.replit.app` URL to access your app.
- **Custom error pages**: Create and serve a custom 404 error page.
- **Monitoring**: View logs and monitor your deployment’s status.

## [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#usage)  Usage

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#primary-domain)  Primary domain

Specify the subdomain part of the hostname for your deployment. After you deploy, you can access your deployment at `https://<subdomain>.replit.app`.

To learn how to use a custom domain, see [Custom Domains](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains/).

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#private-deployment)  Private deployment

The private deployment feature is available for Teams and Enterprise plans only.

Private deployments grant permission to your app only to members of your team or organization.
This control lets you toggle whether to make your deployment private.

To learn how to set up a private deployment, see [Private Deployments](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/private-deployments).

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#public-directory)  Public directory

Specify the base directory path in your Replit App that contains the static files you want to serve publicly.
After you deploy, the cloud host serves all pages and assets in that directory.

The default value, `/`, is the root directory of your Replit App.

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#build-command)  Build command

Specify a build command to run in your Replit App’s shell when you create your Deployment.

For example, if you generate a static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
you might use the command `hugo --minify` to generate the files and optimize asset file sizes.

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments\#deployment-secrets)  Deployment secrets

Select **Add deployment secret** to add environment variables or secrets your build command needs to run securely.

For example, if your site generator requires an API key to create your static site, you might pass it
`API_KEY=<your secret name>`.
